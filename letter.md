Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding Severely Jammed Gutter in [Your Society Name]

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am writing to bring to your immediate attention a serious issue in our society, [Your Society Name], located in [Area/Locality Name]. For the past few days, the gutters in our society have been severely jammed, resulting in an alarming situation where sewage waste is continuously overflowing from the lids, like water. This is not only creating an unbearable stench but also posing a significant health hazard to the residents.

The situation has become increasingly worse, with raw sewage flowing onto the streets and pathways, making it difficult for residents to walk without encountering this waste. This unsanitary condition is extremely concerning, especially considering the potential for the spread of diseases.

Despite several verbal complaints to the local authorities, no action has been taken so far to address this issue. We urgently request the Pune Municipal Corporation to send a team to inspect and rectify the situation immediately. The residents of [Your Society Name] are deeply distressed by this problem, and we hope that the PMC will take swift action to resolve it.

We trust that you will treat this matter with the urgency it deserves and ensure that the necessary steps are taken to clear the jammed gutters and prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Yours sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Designation, if any]
[Your Society Name]
